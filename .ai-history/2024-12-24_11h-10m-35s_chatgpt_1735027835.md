# askCallback() factorization

Tell your opinion about the way the `askCallback()` function factorization is done 
in `./lua/ai/gemini/query.lua`, `./lua/ai/chatgpt/query.lua` and `./lua/ai/common.lua` files.

The `askCallback()` function is a crucial part of the interaction with the AI models in your Neovim plugin. It is responsible for handling the response from the API calls made to the Gemini and ChatGPT models. Let's analyze the factorization of this function across the three files: `./lua/ai/gemini/query.lua`, `./lua/ai/chatgpt/query.lua`, and `./lua/ai/common.lua`.

### 1. **Common Functionality in `common.lua`**

The `askCallback()` function is defined in `common.lua`, which is a good practice for code reuse. This allows both the Gemini and ChatGPT modules to share the same logic for handling API responses. Hereâ€™s a breakdown of its structure:

```lua
function common.askCallback(res, opts, formatResult)
  local result
  if res.status ~= 200 then
    if opts.handleError ~= nil then
      result = opts.handleError(res.status, res.body)
    else
      common.log("Error: API responded with the status " .. tostring(res.status) .. '\n\n' .. res.body)
      result = 'Error: API responded with the status ' .. tostring(res.status) .. '\n\n' .. res.body
    end
  else
    local data = vim.fn.json_decode(res.body)
    result = formatResult(data) -- Call the provided formatting function
    if opts.handleResult ~= nil then
      result = opts.handleResult(result)
    end
  end
  opts.callback(result)
end
```

#### **Pros:**
- **Reusability:** By placing the function in `common.lua`, you avoid code duplication and make it easier to maintain.
- **Flexibility:** The function accepts a `formatResult` parameter, allowing different formatting functions to be used for different models.

#### **Cons:**
- **Coupling:** The `askCallback()` function is tightly coupled with the response structure of the API. If the API changes, you may need to update this function and the formatting functions in both Gemini and ChatGPT modules.

### 2. **Usage in `gemini/query.lua` and `chatgpt/query.lua`**

In both `gemini/query.lua` and `chatgpt/query.lua`, the `askCallback()` function is invoked with a specific formatting function:

```lua
query.askCallback = function(res, opts)
  common.askCallback(res, opts, query.formatResult)
end
```

#### **Pros:**
- **Simplicity:** The usage is straightforward, making it clear that the `askCallback()` function is being called with a specific formatting function.
- **Separation of Concerns:** Each module can define its own `formatResult` function, which keeps the formatting logic specific to the model.

#### **Cons:**
- **Redundancy:** The definition of `query.askCallback` in both files is almost identical, which could be seen as redundant. If you need to change the way `askCallback` is invoked, you will have to do it in two places.

### 3. **Recommendations for Improvement**

To improve the factorization and maintainability of the `askCallback()` function, consider the following:

- **Centralize the Callback Definition:** Instead of defining `query.askCallback` in both `gemini/query.lua` and `chatgpt/query.lua`, you could define a single function in `common.lua` that takes the model type as an argument. This would reduce redundancy and make it easier to manage changes.

- **Error Handling Strategy:** Consider implementing a more robust error handling strategy that can be reused across different models. This could involve defining a standard error response format that all models adhere to.

- **Documentation:** Ensure that the purpose and usage of the `askCallback()` function are well-documented, especially since it is a shared function. This will help future developers understand its role and how to extend or modify it.

### Conclusion

Overall, the factorization of the `askCallback()` function is a good start, leveraging common functionality to reduce redundancy. However, there is room for improvement in terms of reducing redundancy in the callback definitions and enhancing error handling. By centralizing the callback logic and ensuring clear documentation, you can make the codebase more maintainable and easier to understand.
