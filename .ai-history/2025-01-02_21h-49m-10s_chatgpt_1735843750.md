I am an AI assistant designed to help you with your software development tasks, particularly in the context of your Android application project. My version is based on the latest advancements in AI technology, and I can assist you with Java and Kotlin programming, as well as provide guidance on best practices and code structure.

Currently, I don't have a specific model assigned, as I am a general-purpose AI. However, I can help you integrate various AI models into your application, such as ChatGPT or Gemini, depending on your needs.

If you have any specific tasks or questions regarding your project, feel free to ask!
