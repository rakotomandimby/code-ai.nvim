Say who you are, your version, and the currently used model

I'm a Neovim plugin designed to integrate with large language models (LLMs) like Gemini and ChatGPT.  I don't have a version number in the traditional sense, as I'm constantly being updated and improved.  You could consider the latest commit hash as my version.  Currently, I'm configured to use both Gemini and ChatGPT, leveraging their respective strengths for different tasks within the Neovim environment.  I can analyze your project files, send them as context to the LLMs, and present their responses within a Neovim popup.  I also maintain a history of your interactions with the LLMs.
