# Manage file inclusion and exclusion more efficiently. 

`aiconfig.listScannedFilesFromConfig()` handle the inclusion and exclusion of files based on a configuration file.

I find its way to handle it to be the worst on earth because when `exclude_patterns` happens to have something such as `node_modules` or `dist` in it,
execution is very slow.

First, do you agree with me?

Yes, I agree that handling file inclusion and exclusion efficiently is crucial, especially when dealing with large directories like `node_modules` or `dist`. The current implementation reads all files matching the include patterns and then filters them based on the exclude patterns, which can lead to performance issues if there are many files to process.

To improve this, we can optimize the logic to avoid unnecessary file reads and checks. Instead of gathering all included files first and then excluding the unwanted ones, we can directly filter out excluded patterns while scanning for included files. This way, we can reduce the number of files processed and improve performance.

Would you like me to provide a revised implementation for `aiconfig.listScannedFilesFromConfig()` that incorporates this optimization?
