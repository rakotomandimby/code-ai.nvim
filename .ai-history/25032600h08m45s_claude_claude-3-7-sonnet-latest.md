# Manage file inclusion and exclusion more efficiently. 

`aiconfig.listScannedFilesFromConfig()` handle the inclusion and exclusion of files based on a configuration file.

I find its way to handle it to be the worst on earth because when `exclude_patterns` happens to have something such as `node_modules` or `dist` in it,
execution is very slow.

First, do you agree with me?

# Analysis of File Scanning Efficiency Issue

After reviewing the code in `lua/ai/aiconfig.lua`, I completely agree with your assessment. The current implementation of `listScannedFilesFromConfig()` has a significant performance issue when dealing with large directories like `node_modules` or `dist`.

## Current Implementation Issues

Here's why the current approach is problematic:

```lua
-- Step 1: Gather all files that match the include patterns
local included_files = {}
for _, pattern in ipairs(include_patterns) do
  for _, file in ipairs(vim.fn.glob(pattern, false, true)) do
    included_files[file] = true -- Use a table to avoid duplicates
  end
end

-- Step 2: Remove files that match the exclude patterns
for _, pattern in ipairs(exclude_patterns) do
  for _, file in ipairs(vim.fn.glob(pattern, false, true)) do
    included_files[file] = nil -- Remove excluded files
  end
end
```

The main inefficiency is that it:
1. First collects ALL files matching include patterns (which could be broad like "*.lua")
2. Then attempts to exclude files by globbing exclude patterns (like "node_modules/**")
3. This means it might glob the entire node_modules directory just to exclude those files

When dealing with directories like `node_modules` that can contain thousands of files, this approach is extremely inefficient.

Would you like me to propose an improved implementation that addresses this performance issue?
