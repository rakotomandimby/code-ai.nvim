# In the `common.lua` file, append syntax.

In the `common.lua` file, appending the `X-MarkdownBlog-Public` header to the headers seems suspicious to me.
I expected something like table.insert(headers, "X-MarkdownBlog-Public: true") to be used instead.

Is the current code a shortcut for appending in a table?
