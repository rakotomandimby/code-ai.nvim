# In the `common.lua` file, append syntax.

In the `common.lua` file, appending the `X-MarkdownBlog-Public` header to the headers seems suspicious to me.
I expected something like table.insert(headers, "X-MarkdownBlog-Public: true") to be used instead.

Is the current code a shortcut for appending in a table?

The current code in `common.lua` uses this snippet to add the `X-MarkdownBlog-Public` header:

```lua
if is_public == true then
  headers['X-MarkdownBlog-Public'] = 'true'
  common.log("Setting upload as public for " .. model_name)
end
```

This is **correct and idiomatic** Lua syntax for adding a key-value pair to a table. In Lua, tables are associative arrays, and you add or update entries by assigning a value to a key, like:

```lua
table[key] = value
```

This is **not** the same as appending a value to an array-like table (which uses `table.insert`). Here, `headers` is a dictionary (map) of HTTP header names to their values, so adding a header is done by setting the key to the header name and the value to the header value.

The alternative you suggested:

```lua
table.insert(headers, "X-MarkdownBlog-Public: true")
```

would append a string to the array part of the table, which is **not** how HTTP headers are typically represented in Lua HTTP client libraries like plenary.curl. They expect a table mapping header names to values, not a list of strings.

**Summary:**

- The current code is the correct way to add a header to the headers table.
- It is not a shortcut; it is the standard way to add a key-value pair to a Lua table.
- Using `table.insert` here would be incorrect and likely cause the HTTP request to fail or send malformed headers.

No change is needed in this part of the code.
