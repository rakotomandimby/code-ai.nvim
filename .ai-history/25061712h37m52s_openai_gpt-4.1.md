# What is the maximum size it can handle?

When handling large files, plenary gives this error:

```
Error executing callback:                                                                                                                                                                                                          
.../.local/share/nvim/lazy/plenary.nvim/lua/plenary/job.lua:406: Failed to spawn process
```

Looking at the documentation on Internet, I cannot find any information about the maximum size of files that plenary can handle.
Tell me the maximum size of files that plenary can handle, or how to find it out.


# OPN **Short Answer:**  
There is **no explicit documented maximum file size** for plenary.nvim’s file reading functions, but practical limits are imposed by your system’s resources (RAM, OS limits, Neovim’s process model, and Lua’s memory management). The error you see is not a plenary-specific file size limit, but a system-level process spawning/resource exhaustion issue.

## Details

### 1. **Plenary’s File Handling**
- Plenary.nvim is a Lua library for Neovim, and its file reading (e.g., `plenary.path`, `plenary.filetype`, `plenary.curl`, etc.) ultimately uses either:
  - Lua’s built-in file I/O (`io.open`, `io.read`, etc.)
  - Neovim’s APIs (`vim.loop.fs_*` from libuv)
  - External processes (for jobs, not for simple file reads)

- **None of these have a hard-coded file size limit in plenary.**

### 2. **Where Do Limits Come From?**
- **Lua**: Can read files as large as available memory allows, but reading a multi-GB file into a Lua string/table will likely exhaust RAM or hit LuaJIT’s 2GB string limit.
- **libuv (vim.loop)**: No explicit file size limit, but again, you’re limited by system memory and 32-bit/64-bit process limits.
- **Neovim**: Can open large files, but editing/viewing multi-GB files is impractical.
- **Plenary Job**: If you use `plenary.job` to spawn a process (e.g., to run `cat` or `rg` on a huge file), you may hit OS process limits, ulimit, or pipe buffer limits.

### 3. **Your Error**
```
.../plenary.nvim/lua/plenary/job.lua:406: Failed to spawn process
```
- This is a **process spawning error**, not a file size error.
- Possible causes:
  - Too many processes open (ulimit -u)
  - Too many open files (ulimit -n)
  - Out of memory
  - Path to executable not found
  - Permissions issue

### 4. **How to Find the Maximum Size?**
- **There is no fixed maximum.** It depends on:
  - Your available RAM
  - Whether you’re using 32-bit or 64-bit Neovim/Lua
  - The OS’s process and file handle limits
  - How you read the file (all at once, or in chunks/streams)

#### **To empirically test:**
- Try reading increasingly large files with your code.
- Monitor memory usage (`htop`, `top`).
- Watch for errors (out of memory, process limits, etc).

#### **To avoid issues:**
- For very large files, **read in chunks** instead of all at once.
- Avoid using `plenary.job` to spawn processes on huge files unless you know the process can handle it.

## **Summary Table**

| Layer         | Hard Limit? | Typical Limitations                  |
|---------------|-------------|--------------------------------------|
| Plenary.nvim  | No          | System resources, Lua limits         |
| Lua           | No          | RAM, LuaJIT 2GB string limit         |
| Neovim        | No          | RAM, performance, buffer size        |
| OS            | No          | RAM, ulimit, process/file handles    |

## **What Should You Do?**
- **If you need to handle very large files,** process them in chunks/streams, not all at once.
- **If you get “Failed to spawn process”,** check your system’s process/file handle limits and memory usage.
- **There is no hard-coded file size limit in plenary.nvim.**
