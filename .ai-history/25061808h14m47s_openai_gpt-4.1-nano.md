# If the command used to run the plugin was "AIRedaction", then do not append the embeded system instructions.

The normal way to run this plugin is to take the user provided system instructions and append the embeded system instructions to it then send it to the AI model.

I would like to introduce an exception to this rule: if the command used to run the plugin was "AIRedaction", then do not append the embeded system instructions.

There are two ways to achieve that:

- implement a configuration option that can be set to true or false
- implement an exception harcoded in the plugin code 

The first option is cleaner and more flexible, but I have no idea about how bad is the second option.

Tell me which one is the best, and reword my query to make it more clear and concise.
Just reword the query, do not answer it.


# OPN Rewording the query for clarity and conciseness

I want to prevent appending embedded system instructions when the plugin is invoked with the command "AIRedaction". Currently, the plugin appends embedded instructions to user-provided instructions before sending them to the AI model. I need this behavior to be conditional: if the command used is "AIRedaction", then skip appending the embedded instructions. 

There are two approaches:

- Add a configurable option to enable or disable this behavior, offering flexibility.
- Hardcode the exception in the plugin code, which is simpler but less flexible.

Please advise which approach is better, and rephrase my request to be clearer and more concise, without providing an answer.
