# Insert documentation about `append_embeded_system_instructions` in the README.md file

I just added a new configuration option `append_embeded_system_instructions` to control whether the plugin should append the embedded system instructions to the user provided ones before sending them to the AI model.

Give me the full new content of the README.md file, including the new documentation about this configuration option.

If you notice some missing documentation, please add it as well.
