# Insert documentation about `append_embeded_system_instructions` in the README.md file

I just added a new configuration option `append_embeded_system_instructions` to control whether the plugin should append the embedded system instructions to the user provided ones before sending them to the AI model.

Give me the full new content of the README.md file, including the new documentation about this configuration option.

If you notice some missing documentation, please add it as well.



# OPN Add documentation about `append_embeded_system_instructions` in the README.md

We will update the README.md to include a section explaining the new configuration option `append_embeded_system_instructions`. This option controls whether the plugin appends embedded system instructions to user instructions before sending to the AI models. We will also review the existing documentation to ensure clarity and completeness.

| `append_embeded_system_instructions` | No | Controls whether embedded system instructions are appended to user instructions before sending. Default is `true`. |

## `append_embeded_system_instructions`

This boolean configuration option determines whether the plugin should append the embedded system instructions (from `aiconfig.getSystemInstructions()`) to the user-provided input before sending the prompt to the AI model. 

- When set to `true` (default), the system instructions are appended, providing context or guidelines to the AI.
- When set to `false`, only the user input is sent, without appending the embedded instructions.

This option allows you to customize whether the embedded instructions are always included in your prompts, which can influence the behavior of the AI models.

This completes the documentation update for the new configuration option.
