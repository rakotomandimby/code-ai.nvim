# Scope of `append_embeded_system_instructions`

I just added a new configuration option `append_embeded_system_instructions` to control whether the plugin should append the embedded system instructions to the user provided ones before sending them to the AI model.

I dont know if this is a global setting or a command-level setting.

Help me to figure it out.


# OPN Analysis of the Scope of `append_embeded_system_instructions` in the Plugin

You have introduced a new configuration option, `append_embeded_system_instructions`, to control whether embedded system instructions are appended to user-provided ones before sending to the AI model. I will analyze your codebase to determine whether this option should be global, command-level, or both.

## Analysis

### 1. Where is `append_embeded_system_instructions` defined and used?

- In `lua/ai/init.lua`, it is defined in `M.opts` as a global option:
  ```lua
  M.opts = {
    ...
    append_embeded_system_instructions = true,
  }
  ```
- In the `M.handle` function, it is used as follows:
  ```lua
  local append_embeded = M.opts.append_embeded_system_instructions
  if def.append_embeded_system_instructions ~= nil then
    append_embeded = def.append_embeded_system_instructions
  end
  local instruction = aiconfig.getSystemInstructions(append_embeded)
  ```
  This means:
    - The global default is `M.opts.append_embeded_system_instructions`.
    - If the command definition (`def`) has its own `append_embeded_system_instructions`, it overrides the global value for that command.

### 2. How is it settable?

- In `M.setup`, you allow users to pass an `opts` table, which can set the global value.
- In the `prompts` table, each command can have its own `append_embeded_system_instructions` value.

### 3. How is it used in the code?

- When handling a command, the code checks for a command-level override, otherwise falls back to the global value.

## Conclusion

**The `append_embeded_system_instructions` option is both a global and a command-level setting:**

- **Global:** Set in `M.opts`, applies to all commands by default.
- **Command-level:** Can be overridden per-command in the `prompts` table by setting `append_embeded_system_instructions` for that command.

This is a flexible and robust approach, allowing users to set a default behavior but override it for specific commands as needed.

## Files Involved

- `lua/ai/init.lua` (main logic for option scope and usage)
- `lua/ai/aiconfig.lua` (uses the value passed in)
- User configuration (where `opts` and `prompts` are set)

## Summary Table

| Scope         | How to Set                                    | Applies To                  |
|---------------|-----------------------------------------------|-----------------------------|
| Global        | `opts.append_embeded_system_instructions`      | All commands (default)      |
| Command-level | `prompts.<command>.append_embeded_system_instructions` | That specific command only  |

## Recommendation

- **Document** this dual-scope behavior in your README or user documentation.
- **Keep** this pattern, as it provides maximum flexibility.

No code changes are needed; your current implementation is correct and robust.
