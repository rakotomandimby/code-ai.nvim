# Scope of `append_embeded_system_instructions`

I just added a new configuration option `append_embeded_system_instructions` to control whether the plugin should append the embedded system instructions to the user provided ones before sending them to the AI model.

I dont know if this is a global setting or a command-level setting.

Help me to figure it out.
