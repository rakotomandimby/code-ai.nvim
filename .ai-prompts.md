# Replace built-in Lua file access with vim's built-in functions

I think I access filesystem with built-in Lua functions like `io.open`, `io.read`, etc.
I should use vim's built-in functions like `vim.fn.readfile`, `vim.fn.writefile`, etc. instead.

Tell the relevant code to replace and give me the full fixed file contents.
