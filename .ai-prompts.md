# Handle Errors

When the Anthropic API answers with other than an HTTP 200 status code, the response has this structure:

```json
{"type":"error","error":{"type":"overloaded_error","message":"Overloaded"}}
```

When the ChatGPT API answers with other than an HTTP 200 status code, the response has this structure:

```json
{"error":
  {
    "message":"This model's maximum context length is 128000 tokens.",
    "type":"invalid_request_error",
    "param":"messages",
    "code":"context_length_exceeded"
  }
}
```

When the Gemini API answers with other than an HTTP 200 status code, the response has this structure:

```json
{
  "error": {
    "code": 400,
    "message": "The request is missing a required parameter, includes an invalid parameter value, includes a parameter more than once, or is otherwise malformed.",
    "status": "BAD_REQUEST"
  }
}
```

I want to gracefully handle specific API errors from Anthropic, ChatGPT, and Gemini in respective `query.ask()` methods. 
We do not touch the `query.askHeavy()`.

I want the `query.ask()` method of each API to handle, extract the error message, and display it. 

Tell me the modifications to make to the code in order to achieve that.
