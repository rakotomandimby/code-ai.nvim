# Make `aiconfig.listScannedFilesAsFormattedTable()` print a beautiful table 

The current implementation of `aiconfig.listScannedFilesAsFormattedTable()` prints two lists of files in two tabble column.

- Values are accurate
- First column formatting is wrong: the right border of the first column is not aligned at all.
- Second column formatting is wrong: the right border of the second column is not aligned at all.

Lets change the code of `aiconfig.listScannedFilesAsFormattedTable()` to make a first pass loop dedicated to maximum file name length calculation, 
and a second pass loop to print the table.

Remove checking terminal size, because displaying that list is done inside a pop-up in a terminal application.

Propose me the changes to make to `aiconfig.listScannedFilesAsFormattedTable()` to make it print a beautiful table.
