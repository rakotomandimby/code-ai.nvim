# Manage file inclusion and exclusion more efficiently. 

`aiconfig.listScannedFilesFromConfig()` handle the inclusion and exclusion of files based on a configuration file.

I find its way to handle it to be the worst on earth because when `exclude_patterns` happens to have something such as `node_modules` or `dist` in it,
execution is very slow.

Propose a better way to handle file inclusion and exclusion based on a configuration file.
Note that sorting the result on file size must be kept.
