# Make `aiconfig.listScannedFilesAsFormattedTable()` print a beautiful table 

The current implementation of `aiconfig.listScannedFilesAsFormattedTable()` prints two lists of files in two tabble column.

But when I have long file names, it seems the code cant handle it.
On some projects, it prints the following error:

```
Error executing Lua callback: .../.local/share/nvim/lazy/code-ai.nvim/lua/ai/aiconfig.lua:291: invalid option '%-115' to 'format'                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           
```

Is it really a problem of file name being too long?
