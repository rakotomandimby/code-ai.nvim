# Make `aiconfig.listScannedFilesAsFormattedTable()` print a beautiful table 

The current implementation of `aiconfig.listScannedFilesAsFormattedTable()` prints two lists of files in two tabble column.

- Values are accurate
- First column formatting is correct
- Second column formatting is wrong: the right border of the second column is not aligned at all.

I guess if the first column left and right borders are aligned, 
the maximum width of the content has been calculated somewhere 
so that the second column alignement could leverage it.

Propose a solution to fix the second column right border alignment.
