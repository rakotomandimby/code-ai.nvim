# Have public posts upload.

For that module configuration, there are the following paremeters:

- `upload_url`: The URL to which the file will be uploaded.
- `upload_token`: The token used for authentication during the upload process.

I want to add a new configuration option to this module that allows users to specify that the uploaded file should be public.

- `upload_as_public`: A boolean value indicating whether the uploaded file should be public or not.
    - Default value is `false`.
    - If `upload_as_public` is set to `true`, the upload HTTP call will add a header `X-MarkdownBlog-Public: true` to the request.
    - In all other cases, the header will not be added. 

Tell me the modifications I need to make to the code in order to implement this feature.
