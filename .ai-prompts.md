# Align formatting in `lua/ai/openai/query.lua`

In `lua/ai/openai/query.lua`, ensure that the formatting is consistent with the other `query.lua` files.
Specifically, the `openai/query.lua` file displays tokens without the "k" suffix, while the other files use "k" to denote thousands of tokens.

Give me the full content of the `formatREsults` function from `lua/ai/openai/query.lua`, modified to include the "k" suffix for thousands of tokens.
