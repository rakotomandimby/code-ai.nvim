# In `common.lua`, `vim.api.nvim_err_writeln()` is reported to be deprecated.

There are some deprecated functions use in the whole codebase, like `vim.api.nvim_err_writeln()`.
Analyze the codebase, find deprecated functions calls and tell me the whole new content of any file I have to modify in order not to use deprecated functions anymore.
