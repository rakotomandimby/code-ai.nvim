# Having system instruction in a `.ai-system-instructions.md` file.

Currently, system instructions are given in command definition.

I want to change that: I want to have a `.ai-system-instructions.md` file that contains all the system instructions.

The system instructions file will be located in the same directory as the `.ai-prompts.md` file.

We will have to remove givin the system instructions in the command definition.

Tell me the modifications I have to make to the code in order to implement this feature.
