# Append the content of `./lua/ai/common-system-instructions.md` to the user defined system common-system-instructions

In this plugin, I embeded a markdown file that contains the common system instructions that will be used by the AI to generate responses.
There instructions are to be hardcoded in the AI plugin and will not be changed by the user.
In `./lua/ai/aiconfig.lua`, I attempt to read the content of this file and append it to the user defined system instructions.
I fail to get the base path of the plugin in order to read the file.

 Give me the full new content of `./lua/ai/aiconfig.lua` to read the content of the plugin system instructions file and append it to the user defined system instructions.
