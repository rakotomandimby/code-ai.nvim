# Set project root to the directory where there is a `.git` folder

Whatever is the project, I want to set the project root to the directory where there is a `.git` folder.

Then I want the plugin to look for the `.ai-scanned-files` file in that precise project root directory.

Tell me the changes I need to make to the plugin to achieve this.
