# Propose iprovement to `aiconfig.listScannedFilesAsText`

The `aiconfig.listScannedFilesAsText` function has complex logic for formatting the list of scanned files. 
This could be simplified using string manipulation functions like `table.concat`.  
The special handling for one, two, and three or more files adds unnecessary complexity.

Propose a better version of that function that does not break working code.
