# What is the maximum size it can handle?

When handling large files, plenary gives this error:

```
Error executing callback:                                                                                                                                                                                                          
.../.local/share/nvim/lazy/plenary.nvim/lua/plenary/job.lua:406: Failed to spawn process
```

Looking at the documentation on Internet, I cannot find any information about the maximum size of files that plenary can handle.
Tell me the maximum size of files that plenary can handle, or how to find it out.
