# Have a configuration option to control system instructions appending  

The normal way to run this plugin is to take the user provided system instructions and append the embeded system instructions to it then send it to the AI model.

I would like to introduce an exception to this rule: if the command used to run the plugin has a configuration option `append_embeded_system_instructions` set to false, then the plugin should not append the embeded system instructions to the user provided ones before sending them to the AI model.

The defult behavior should remain unchanged, meaning that if the configuration option is not set or set to true, the plugin should append the embedded system instructions as usual.

There should be a global configuration option that can be set to control this behavior, and it should be possible to override this option on a per-command basis.

Tell me the full new code of the files I need to change in order to implement this feature.


# New README.md content after adding `append_embeded_system_instructions`

I just added a new configuration option `append_embeded_system_instructions` to control whether the plugin should append the embedded system instructions to the user provided ones before sending them to the AI model.

Give me the full new content of the README.md file, including the new documentation about this configuration option.

If you notice some missing documentation, please add it as well.
