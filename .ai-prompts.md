# In `query.lua` files, if the model is the "disabled" string, don't query but just return "Model is disabled".

For each of the three `query.lua` files, I want that if the model name is the string "disabled", 
the `ask` and `askHeavy` functions must not perform real query to the model or the agent, 
but should return a JSON that will mwke the plugin to show a message like "Model is disabled".

Tell me the modifications to make to the three `query.lua` files to achieve this.
